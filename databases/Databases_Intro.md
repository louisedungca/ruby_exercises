## Introduction to Databases

Database
- a organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system
- stored in the hard disk (i.e. HDD, SSD)
** HDD / SDD == storage

Main Kinds (or Paradigms) of DBs:
1. Relational DB
- root word: relation
- "relation" == table
- "field" == column == attribute
- "record" == row

2. Non-relational DB
- doesn't use tables
- uses a different data structure

** We'll focus on Relational DB

DBMS
- Database Management System
- software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data

RDBMS
- Relational DBMS
- e.g. SQLite, MySQL, PostgresSQL, MariaDB

  SQL
  - Structured Query Language
  - like a programming language for databases
  - For each RDBMS, there is a specific implementation of SQL


Non-relational DBMS
- e.g. MongoDB
- NoSQL
