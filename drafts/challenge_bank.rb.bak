## 6.1 Enough is enough!
# Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering.
# For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].

# def delete_nth()
# end

## Execute:
# delete_nth([1, 1, 1, 1], 2) # => [1,1]
# delete_nth([20, 37, 20, 21], 1) # [20, 37, 21]
